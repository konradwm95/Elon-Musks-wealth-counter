          The numbers on this page don't show the current valuation of Elon Musk
          net worth, nor real changes in his net worth in time. The website was
          created to illustrate the size of his fortune and enormous rate of
          enrichment in recent years. Constantly changing net worth amount is
          calculated, based on the net worth on 19.11.21, when it was $ 311
          billions. A year earlier, this value was 123 $ billions, which is an
          increase of $ 188 billions a year, or 5,961 $ / second.
