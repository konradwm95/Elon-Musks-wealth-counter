# Elon-Musks-wealth-counter

The site has a counter showing Elon Musk's current net worth, as well as other data related to how quickly he's getting rich. The page does not show the actual valuation of Musk's assets, and the methodology of the calculations performed is described in the footer of the page.

## Project goals

The main goal of the project was to implement an algorithm developed by me that converts all arbitrarily large integers into four-digit floating point numbers. I also wanted to create a nice looking responsive website with interesting content.
